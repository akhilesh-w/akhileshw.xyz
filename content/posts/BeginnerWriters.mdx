ðŸ’¡Writing- Here you draft your actual document, You write whatever you want to say about the topic, Obviously, after doing good research about the topic.

You write everything here about the topic and re-read the same.

ðŸ’¡Editing- Now, this is the final round and itâ€™s a crucial one.

Here you rearrange your words, sentences, etc, and take out and add parts( if necessary)

You do proofreading, where you check every spelling, and grammatical error, correct your small mistakes, etc.
