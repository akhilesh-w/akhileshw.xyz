I have a draft in my logseq for a while now. It’s titled: **“Just Post Something”**

Inside, it’s a mess of bullet points about how I “don’t create enough”, how I want to be a “generalist polymath,” and how annoyed I am that all my hobbies cost a “f*ck ton of money.”

But the line that hit me hardest when I re-read it this evening was this:

> I don’t yet have clarity on what to do yet, and I heard clarity is derived from actions, so I’m going to focus more on creating some motion.

I’ve spent way too much time waiting for ‘clarity’ before starting anything. I’d tell myself that the friction I felt was just a lack of info, that if I just read one more article or watched one more video, I’d finally be ready. But you don’t get permission from reading. I was just using research as a sophisticated form of procrastination.

The only thing that happened was that I got older, and that quiet frustration started turning into a restless energy I had no idea how to channel.

### The “Polymath” Trap

I’ve always wanted to be at the intersection of everything. Design. Code. Writing. Investing. But wanting to do everything usually results in doing nothing. It feels like you’re standing in the middle of a massive library, paralyzed because you don’t know which book to pull first. You feel the potential energy, but you have zero kinetic energy.

And when you add “economical anxiety” into the mix, the pressure gets weird. You want to follow your curiosity, but you also need to make sure you aren’t broke. I used to think I had to solve the money problem first so I could follow my curiosity later. I was wrong. You have to monetize the pursuit of curiosity while you’re in it. You do both together.

### No More Regrets

I wrote in my journal earlier this week:

> My only wish from life is to not have regrets. I do have a couple of regrets right now, but nothing unfixable with a year well spent.

So this is me spending the year well.
This is me finally thinking out loud.
This is me admitting that I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m doing it anyway.
Clarity doesn’t come from thinking. It comes from motion.
So let’s move.

### Things I’ve been reading this week:

#### **Compound Engineering**
I’ve been obsessed with [this piece](https://every.to/compounding-engineering/coding-is-shifting-to-managing-teams-of-ai-agents) from Every. It talks about how coding is shifting from “writing code” to “managing a team of AI agents.” This is exactly what we mean by vibecoding. It feels less like engineering and more like directing a movie where the actors are LLMs. I’ve been reading Every a lot recently, they write some really good blogs.

#### **Make Something Heavy**
A great reminder from [Working Theorys](https://workingtheorys.com/make-something-heavy). In a world where AI makes it easy to generate content (slop), the only way to stand out is to build things that feel heavy, things that have weight, friction, and visible effort behind them.

#### **The Job Isn’t Just The Job**
I used to think my value was just my output. The code I wrote, or the copy I wrote. [This article](https://www.humanloop.com/blog/the-job-isnt-just-the-job) argues that as AI automates the “work,” the real value shifts to Relational Labor. It’s about trust, context, and the human energy that keeps a team moving. In an automated world, being the person who actually cares is the ultimate moat.

### A personal update

Whenever I get pissed at something, or get anxiety, I just go on a run, or grab my road bike and go on a ride. I’m realizing that physical exhaustion is the best cure for mental anxiety. Also you get brownie dopamine points by logging your activity and completing challenges.
