There's a really nice quote that goes like "We are the average of everything we consume. The movies we watch, the music we listen to, the books we read, etc." Weâ€™re just composed of things that we come across in our lives

We consume so much of data everyday, it can be you watching a real life incident or watching a movie. People who spend time IRL also try to convert that memory into digital memory, so it becomes a photo in your phone. 

The whole purpose of this post is me being a curator and me curating everything that there is to curate. for example: 
We retweet and bookmark tweets that we relate to, we save posts on Instagram, Pinterest, we make playlists on spotify, we rate and make lists of movies on Letterboxd, Goodreads, Podcasts, Blogs, etc. The list goes on. May it be a Amazon shopping list or a myntra one or some snickers app. This has nothing to do with capitalism or marketing, this is just stuff that you curated by yourself and this represents a part of you.

In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the "artifacts" of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy. The things we (uniquely) enjoy are informed by factors as varied and disparate as our blood-sugar levels, among other things. We carefully display our "exhibit of love" in beautiful frames and tags. 

Or, to put it differently - imagine an unimaginably vast wall that contains every interest, hobby, passion, and person to ever exist. The concepts of "self" and "taste" let us envision this entire wall illuminated, with every possibility available for the curator- that's you- to explore, evaluate, and choose from. You look at this wall and you pick and choose the elements that resonate most with you.

This lists we keep changing as we go through life, there's a month where I watch a lot of movies and make lists of movies I have to watch and then next 6 months I don't watch a single movie. Same goes with other hobbies and passions. Maybe you get into snickers someday and curate all the snickers you want to collect and then after completing that mission you'll get onto something new. It's like a giant list of things that we've to tick off. This shift is a natural part of curating your own wall of interests and experiences. Our tastes and preferences evolve over time, and so does the arrangement of what captivates us. What was once an obsession might become a cherished memory.

Just as a museum collection is a reflection of the curator's vision and taste, our love is a reflection of who we are - an evolving, imperfect, and profoundly human work of art.
